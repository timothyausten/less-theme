                <H1>Your local architectural expert</H1>
                <p>Andre has been the very best architect in the area for over 7 years and aspires to be the greatest, knock-your-socks-off designer in the country.</p>
                <H1>Functionality</H1>
                <p>Andre's designs are the best that you could ask for in terms of practicability. Doors open in the right direction, floor plans are accessible, and kitchen windows are located above sinks to facilitate garden gazing whilst cleaning up.</p>
                <!--<H1>Stunning designs</H1>
                <p>Andre's designs are attractive. They are tailor made to not only fit your neighborhood but to make it look great, as well.</p>-->
